ðŸ“° Fake News Detection System

This project implements a robust **Fake News Detection** system using three machine learning models: **Naive Bayes**, **Random Forest**, and **LSTM**. The system classifies news articles as **Fake** or **Real** based on their textual content.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Clean and preprocess news articles (lowercasing, stopword removal, stemming).
- Train and evaluate:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Random Forest
  - LSTM (with embedding and sequence padding)
- Visual performance comparison of models
- Confusion matrices and classification reports
- Supports custom input testing for new articles

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies

Make sure to install the following libraries before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn keras tensorflow
