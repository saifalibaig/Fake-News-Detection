# ðŸ“° Fake News Detection System

This project implements a robust **Fake News Detection** system using three machine learning models: **Naive Bayes**, **Random Forest**, and **LSTM**. The system classifies news articles as **Fake** or **Real** based on their textual content.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Clean and preprocess news articles (lowercasing, stopword removal, stemming).
- Train and evaluate:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Random Forest
  - LSTM (with embedding and sequence padding)
- Visual performance comparison of models
- Confusion matrices and classification reports
- Supports custom input testing for new articles

---

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies

Make sure to install the following libraries before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn keras tensorflow

```

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

**Dataset used:** [Fake and Real News Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)

It contains two CSV files:
- `Fake.csv`
- `True.csv`

Each article is labeled accordingly and preprocessed before training:
- HTML tags and punctuation removed
- Lowercased text
- Tokenization and stopword removal
- Optional stemming for traditional models
